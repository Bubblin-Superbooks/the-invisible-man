Just imagination?"</p><p>"What else can you be?" said Mr. Thomas Marvel, rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>"Very well," said the Voice, in a tone of relief. "Then I'm going to throw flints at you till you think differently."</p><p>"But where are yer?"</p><p>The Voice made no answer.

Mr. Marvel, turning, saw a flint jerk up into the air, trace a complicated path, hang for a moment, and then fling at his feet with almost invisible rapidity. He was too amazed to dodge. Whizz it came, and ricochetted from a bare toe into the ditch. Mr. Thomas Marvel jumped a foot and howled aloud. Then he started to run, tripped over an unseen obstacle, and came head over heels into a sitting position.</p></div> </div>
