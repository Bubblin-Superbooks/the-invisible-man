No doubt invisibility made it possible to get them, but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got. Ambition&mdash;what is the good of pride of place when you cannot appear there? What is the good of the love of woman when her name must needs be Delilah? I have no taste for politics, for the blackguardisms of fame, for philanthropy, for sport. What was I to do? And for this I had become a wrapped-up mystery, a swathed and bandaged caricature of a man!"</p></div> </div>
