I turned down one of the roads leading from Gower Street to Tottenham Court Road, and found myself outside Omniums, the big establishment where everything is to be bought&mdash;you know the place: meat, grocery, linen, furniture, clothing, oil paintings even&mdash;a huge meandering collection of shops rather than a shop. I had thought I should find the doors open, but they were closed, and as I stood in the wide entrance a carriage stopped outside, and a man in uniform&mdash;you know the kind of personage with 'Omnium' on his cap&mdash;flung open the door. I contrived to enter, and walking down the shop&mdash;it was a department where they were selling ribbons and gloves and stockings and that kind of thing&mdash;came to a more spacious region devoted to picnic baskets and wicker furniture.</p></div> </div>
