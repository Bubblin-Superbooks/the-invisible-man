It is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air. And for precisely the same reason!"</p><p>"Yes," said Kemp, "that is pretty plain sailing."</p><p>"And here is another fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of glass is smashed, Kemp, and beaten into a powder, it becomes much more visible while it is in the air; it becomes at last an opaque white powder. This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur.</p></div> </div>
